  # --- Backend Service (Express API) ---
  backend:
    build:

      dockerfile: Dockerfile
    container_name: notesapp-backend
    restart: always

    # 2. 🟢 CRITICAL FIX: HEALTHCHECK BLOCK (Must be top-level under 'backend')
    healthcheck:
      test: ["CMD", "curl", "-f", "http://localhost:8000/api/protected"] # Assuming /api/protected is the health route
      interval: 30s
      timeout: 10s
      retries: 3
      start_period: 30s # Gives Express and MongoDB time to fully start

  # --- Frontend Service (Vite + Nginx) ---
  frontend:
    build:
      context: ./frontend
      dockerfile: Dockerfile
      args:

    # 🟢 FIX 3: Ensure depends_on links to the health status check
    depends_on:
      backend:
        condition: service_healthy # This is what ensures Nginx waits for Express to be truly ready.
