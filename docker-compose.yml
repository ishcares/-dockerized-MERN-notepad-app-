  backend:
    build:
      context: ./backend
      dockerfile: Dockerfile
    container_name: notesapp-backend
    restart: always

    # 1. Correct Ports: Maps Host Port 8000 to Container Port 8000
    ports:
      - "8000:8000"

      # Allows frontend on 5173 to connect to the backend (CORS)
      - ALLOWED_ORIGIN=http://localhost:5173 
      - PORT=8000
    
    # NOTE: The healthcheck block has been removed to fix the startup failure.

  # --- Frontend Service (Vite + Nginx) ---

    # 2. Correct Ports: Maps Host Port 5173 to Container Nginx Port 80
    ports:
      - "5173:80" 

    # 3. Correct Indentation: Ensures this block belongs to 'frontend'
    environment:
      # Frontend must know the full public URL of the backend service
      - VITE_BACKEND_URL=http://localhost:8000

    # 4. Dependency Fix: Waits for the container to start, not pass a health check
